## What is Awesome CV?

**Awesome CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

Based on [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), I did some layout changes and includes bibtex (see this [PR](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/pull/23/files)) for showing publications.

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
$ biber {your-cv}
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``

#### Issue

You might encounter error shows:
```bash
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!
! fontspec error: "font-not-found"
! 
! The font "FontAwesome" cannot be found.
! 
! See the fontspec documentation for further information.
! 
! For immediate help type H <return>.
!............................................... 
```
This indicate that `FontAwesome` is not installed in your environment. Go to [**Font-Awesome**](http://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/v4.7.0/fonts/FontAwesome.otf) and download this. In mac, you can move it into your application Font Book as installation.

Add a new line in your `cv.tex` for xelax to use this font:
```bash
\usepackage{fontawesome}
```
